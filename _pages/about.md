Hello, I am Zeyu Tang, an MEng student at Imperial College London, majoring in Bioengineering. Much like the development of physics in the 1600s, when Johannes Kepler proposed his three laws based on Tycho Braheâ€™s twenty-year detailed extensive observation of the planet orbits, biology nowadays also has accumulated tons of data thanks to high-throughput technologies. I believe mathematical tools and computational models can help us uncover the mystery of life. My current research focuses on AI in medical imaging. Specifically, I worked on developing segmentation models for airway segmentation and AI explainability. 

My two favourite biologists are Gregor Mendel and Frederick Sanger. They are role models I look up to and will forever inspire my research career.
